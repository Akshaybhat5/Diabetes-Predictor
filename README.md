Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.

The model will predict the diabetes of a person at an accuracy rate of 70%. The repository consist of 2 files and a python file to execute.
1.Jupyter extended file, which is used to analyze, preprocess, cleaning the data, and to build the machine learning oriented models to predict the above.
2. The file with the joblib extention is the ML trained model to deploy on any server.
3. Python file, which is the same coded version of jupyter notebook in .py format.
